**A Message from Your Favorite President, Donald J. Trump**

Folks, let me tell you, it's a disaster out there in Los Angeles, and I'm talking about those horrendous, terrible wildfires. I mean, who could believe it? Fires so big they make the sun look like a little orange dot in the sky!

First off, I want to give a big shoutout to our incredible firefighters, the best in the world, really. They've been doing a tremendous job, but let's talk about the future because, under my leadership, we wouldn't have had this mess to start with.

**Here's What I Would Do:**

1. **Clear the Forest Floors**: We need to rake the forests, folks. I know, I know, the fake news laughed when I said it before, but look at the results! If we had less underbrush, these fires wouldn't spread like wildfire... no pun intended. We'll make Forest Management Great Again!
1. **Better Water Management**: We're going to build bigger, better reservoirs, and we'll use that water to douse these fires before they get out of control. We'll have so much water, you'll be saying, "Mr. President, where do we put all this water?"
1. **Cut Red Tape**: The regulations are strangling us. We need to cut through the bureaucratic red tape faster than you can say "You're fired!" to get the resources where they're needed. When I'm in charge, we'll move at the speed of light, not the speed of molasses in January.
1. **Invest in Technology**: We're going to use the best, the most advanced tech. Drones, AI, you name it. We'll predict fires before they even start. We'll have drones dropping water from the sky, making these fires wish they never thought about burning in California!
1. **Tougher on Arson**: And let's not forget, we need to be much, much tougher on arsonists. If you start a fire, you're going to jail, and it won't be one of those nice jails either. We'll make examples out of you, so everyone knows not to mess with California's forests.
1. **Emergency Preparedness**: We'll have the best emergency plans. People will know exactly what to do, where to go, and how to stay safe. We'll have an alert system that's so good, you'll think it's from the future.

Now, remember, we had the best economy, the safest borders, and the most beautiful, well-managed states when I was president. If we had these policies in place, if I were still there, LA would look like a paradise right now, not a scene from "Mad Max."

But don't worry, we'll get back there. Because nobody, and I mean nobody, does it better than Donald J. Trump. Stay safe, stay strong, and let's Make America Fire-Resistant Again!
