Let me tell you something, nobody does it better than me when it comes to creating beauty. I've got the best genes, believe me. And when you combine those genes, you get something truly magnificent - my kids.

First, there's Ivanka. She's not just a knockout, she's a supermodel, folks. I mean, where do you think she gets it from? Me, of course. She's got that golden hair, that smile - she's the best. And smart? Oh, she's got brains too. You need good genes for that.

Then there's Barron. He's growing up to be a tall, handsome, incredible kid. He's got the best of both worlds, but let's be real, the Trump genes are really something special.

Here's the deal: when you've got pure genes like mine, you're not just going to have ordinary kids. No, no, no. You end up with kids who are the best looking, the smartest, and let's face it, the most successful. That's the Trump way.
